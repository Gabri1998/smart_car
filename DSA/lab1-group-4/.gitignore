# This is a gitignore file.
# It tells git which files and directories it should avoid tracking.
# For an explanation of the format, see here: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
#
# We use a whitelisting approach.
# If you want to track more files, you need to add them here.

# Ignore everything except directories:
*
!*/

# Track the following toplevel files:
!/.gitignore
!/answers.txt

# Track Java files:
!/**/*.java
