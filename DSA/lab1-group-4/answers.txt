**Question**
How many comparisons does `firstIndexOf` use at most for an array of:
a) 10 elements? log2(10) + 1 ≈ 3.32/  The method makes a maximum of 4 comparisons.
b) 100 elements? log2(100) + 1 ≈ 6.64/  The method makes a maximum of 7 comparisons.
c) 1,000 elements? log2(1000) + 1 ≈ 9.97/  The method makes a maximum 10  comparisons.
d) 1,000,000 elements? log2(1000000) + 1 ≈ 19.93/  The method makes a maximum 20  comparisons.

**Question**
How many comparisons would `firstIndexOf` need for 1,000,000,000,000 elements?
(This is way too big for your computer's memory!)
Justify your answer.
The method makes a maximum 40  comparisons.

By applying the logarithmic to base 2 formula for the time complexity of the binary search,
we can determine the number of comparisons for an array of 1,000,000,000,000 elements.

Number of comparisons=log2(number of elements)

In the case of 1000,000,000,000 elements:

The log2(1,000,000,000,000) number of comparisons.The log2(1,000,000,000,000) number of comparisons.

Let's do the math:

There are about 39.86 comparisons.

This means that the method firstIndexOf would require a maximum of 40 comparisons for an array with 1,000,000,000,000 elements.
This shows how effectively binary search can locate a particular element within a large, sorted array of elements.
